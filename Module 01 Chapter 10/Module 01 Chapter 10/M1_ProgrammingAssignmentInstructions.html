<h1>Chapter 10 Programming Assignment  (Version 1)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This assignment relates to content from Chapter 10 of the eText.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Review the General Programming Assignment instructions.</li>
  <li>Write the definition of a class, swimmingPool, to implement  the properties of a swimming pool. 
    <ol>
      <li type="a">Your class should have the instance  variables to store the length (in feet), width (in feet), depth (in feet), the  rate (in gallons per minute) at which the water is filling the pool, and the  rate (in gallons per minute) at which the water is draining from the pool. </li>
      <li type="a">Add  appropriate constructors to initialize the instance variables. </li>
      <li type="a">Also, add member functions to do the following:  determine the amount of water needed to fill an empty or partially filled pool,  determine the time needed to completely or partially fill or empty the pool,  and add or drain water for a specific amount of time.</li>
      <li type="a"> This program must have a  main program that utilizes a header file that defines the class and an  implementation file containing the constructions and functions used in the  class definitions.  </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
