<h1>Chapter 11 Programming Assignment  (Version 1)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This assignment relates to content from Chapter 11 of the eText. </p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Review the General Programming Assignment instructions.</li>
  <li>In this chapter, the class dateType was designed to  implement the date in a program, but the member function setDate and the  constructor do not check whether the date is valid before storing the date in  the member variables. Rewrite the definitions of the function setDate and the  constructor so that the values for the month, day, and year are checked before  storing the date into the member variables. </li>
  <li>Add a member function, isLeapYear,  to check whether a year is a leap year. Moreover, write a test program to test  your class.</li>
  <li>The class dateType was designed and implemented to keep  track of a date, but it has very limited operations. Redefine the class  dateType so that it can perform the following operations on a date, in addition  to the operations already defined:
  <ol>
    <li type="a">Set the month. </li>
    <li type="a">Set the day. </li>
    <li type="a">Set the year. </li>
    <li type="a">Return the month. </li>
    <li type="a">Return the day. </li>
    <li type="a">Return the year.</li>
    <li type="a">Test whether the year is a leap year. </li>
    <li type="a">Return the number of days in the month. For  example, if the date is 3-12-2017, the number of days to be returned is 31  because there are 31 days in March. </li>
    <li type="a">Return the number of days passed in the year.  For example, if the date is 3-18-2017, the number of days passed in the year is  77. Note that the number of days returned also includes the current day. </li>
    <li type="a">Return the number of days remaining in the year.  For example, if the date is 3-18-2017, the number of days remaining in the year  is 288. </li>
    <li type="a">Calculate the new date by adding a fixed number  of days to the date. For example, if the date is 3-18-2017 and the days to be  added are 25, the new date is 4-12-2017.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Write the definitions of the functions to implement the  operations defined for the latest version  of the class dateType.</li>
  <li>    The class dateType prints the date in numerical form. Some  applications might require the date to be printed in another form, such as  March 24, 2017. 
    <ol>
      <li type="a">Derive the class extDateType so that the date can be printed in  either form. </li>
      <li type="a">Add a member variable to the class extDateType so that the month  can also be stored in string form. </li>
      <li type="a">Add a member function to output the month in  the string format, followed by the year—for example, in the form March 2017.  </li>
      <li type="a">Write the definitions of the functions to implement the operations for the  class extDateType.</li>
      <li type="a">        Using the classes extDateType and dayType, design the class  calendarType so that, given the month and the year, we can print the calendar  for that month. To print a monthly calendar, you must know the first day of the  month and the number of days in that month. Thus, you must store the first day  of the month, which is the form dayType, and the month and the year of the  calendar. Clearly, the month and the year can be stored in an object of the  form extDateType by setting the day component of the date to 1 and the month  and year as specified by the user. Thus, the class calendarType has two member  variables: an object of the type dayType and an object of the type extDateType.  </li>
      <li type="a">Design the class calendarType so that the program can print a calendar for any  month starting January 1, 1500. Note that the day of January 1 of the year 1500 is a Monday. To calculate the first day  of a month, you can add the appropriate days to Monday of January 1, 1500.<br />
        </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>For the class calendarType, include the following  operations: </li>
  <ol>
    <li type="a">Determine the first day of the month for which  the calendar will be printed. Call this operation firstDayOfMonth. </li>
    <li type="a">Set the month. </li>
    <li type="a">Set the year. </li>
    <li type="a">Return the month. </li>
    <li type="a">Return the year. </li>
    <li type="a">Print the calendar for the particular month. </li>
    <li type="a">Add the appropriate constructors to initialize  the member variables.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Write the definitions of the member functions of the class to  implement the operations of the class calendarType.<br />
    </li>
  <li>Write a test program to print the calendar for either a  particular month or a particular year. <br />
    <br />
    For example, the calendar for September  2017 is:<br />
    <br />
    September 2017 <br />
    <p>Sun      Mon     Tue      Wed    Thu      Fri        Sat <br />
                                                           1          2 <br />
3          4          5          6          7          8         9 <br />
10        11        12        13         14        15         16        <br />
17        18        19        20         21        22         23        <br />
24        25        26        27         28        29         30</p>
  </li>
</ol>
